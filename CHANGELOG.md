# Changelog

All notable changes to pi-agent-portrait, and to pi-emote before it, are documented in this file.

## v0.4.0

First release as pi-agent-portrait, a fork of [pi-emote](https://github.com/cgxeiji/pi-emote) by @cgxeiji.

### Added
- **`scripts/draw-portrait`**: draws a 30-frame set for a new character with an image model (Codex CLI or Azure OpenAI), from a role and an optional `--direction`, or from a photo with `--photo` and `--photo-style`.
- **Eleven more states**: heard, wait, interrupted, error, bash, search and sleep, plus frames for success. Sets without them fall back to the closest older state.
- **Random takes**: `--variant N` draws the same character in different poses as `frame_vN.png`; one take is picked at random each time a state starts.
- **`/portrait`**: switch the portrait inside pi, from a list or by name; the choice is saved for the project.
- **Example characters**: forge, quill, nova, sprocket, moss, oana and cipher.
- **`--template` and `--print-guide`** for drawing from a finished set and labelling its frames.

### Fixed
- The mouth stops moving once a reply has finished.
- Older kitty (0.32) no longer squashes the portrait.
- Every tool call now ends in success or failure, not only failed bash calls.


## v0.3.0

### Added
- **Multi-line ASCII emotes** — ASCII frames now support 8×4 multi-line canvas with ANSI color codes. Frames can be defined as arrays of strings in `ascii.yaml`.
- **`ascii-bot` emote set** — colored ASCII robot with ANSI green body and yellow eyes. Uses multi-line 8×4 format.
- **ANSI escape support in YAML** — `\x1b`, `\e`, `\n`, `\t`, `\r` escape sequences are now processed in double-quoted strings.
- **Automatic ASCII fallback** — when terminal doesn't support images and configured emote set is image-only, automatically falls back to `ascii-bot`.
- **Thinking level emote mapping** — emote set resolution now matches on thinking level as well as model ID. Entries accept a `thinking-level` selector (`off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`); unset selectors default to `*`, an entry matches when **all** of its selectors match, and last match wins. Emote sets re-resolve live on thinking level changes.
- **Colored info lines** — new `theme` config section colors the info panel: `model-name`, `progress-bar` (default/cache-hit/cache-miss/almost-full), `token-info`, `working-directory`, `border`, and `vertical-separator`. Values are pi theme color tokens or the special `thinking-level-color` flag, which follows the current thinking level's color live. All colors update live when pi's theme changes.
- **Warp terminal support** — new `warpterminal` entry in the terminals config, rendering with the Kitty image protocol.

### Changed
- **ASCII renderer canvas** — fixed 8×4 canvas (8 cols × 4 rows) instead of single-line kaomoji. Frames are vertically centered.
- **YAML parser extended** — supports nested arrays (`string[][]`) for multi-line cycling frames and named multi-line frames.

### Fixed
- **Kitty ghost image artifacts** — previous kitty placements are deleted before re-rendering, since kitty images live on a separate display layer not cleared by `\x1b[2K`.

## v0.2.10

### Added
- **Context usage progress bar** — Visual 20-segment bar with eighth-block granularity. Cache (░) and input (█) portions are shown per segment; input wins when both occupy the same bin.
- **Cache hit rate** — Per-message cache ratio shown in the stats line (⇞).
- **Working directory** — Current directory displayed below stats, shortened with `~`.
- **Token count in bar** — Raw token count displayed alongside percentage.

### Changed
- **Info panel restructured** — Merged thinking level and context window into the model line. Progress bar, cumulative stats (↑↓ cache% $cost), and working directory replace the old context/tokens/cost layout.
- **`formatTokens` uses uppercase `K`** — Kilo suffix now uppercase for consistency.
- **Empty bin char** — Changed from `-` to space for a cleaner look.

## v0.2.9

### Added
- **Red emote**

### Changed
- **hideBelow default to 40** — Fit all content in narrow terminals by default.
- **claude emote** — Claude family of models show red emote by default.

## v0.2.8

### Fixed
- **ASCII YAML escape sequences** — `\"` and `\\` in `ascii.yaml` double-quoted strings are now correctly decoded (e.g. `think hard` and `tool` frames in the default set).

## v0.2.7

### Added
- **Multiple ASCII emote sets** — ASCII sets now use the same resolution/lookup machinery as image sets. Each set is a directory with an `ascii.yaml` file.
- **`ascii-bear` emote set** — bear kaomoji (`ʕ•̫͡•ʔ`) by [@LCorleone](https://github.com/LCorleone).
- **Auto-switch to AsciiRenderer** — sets with `ascii.yaml` but no image frames automatically use the ASCII renderer regardless of terminal capabilities.

### Changed
- **tmux default changed to `"auto"`** — tmux + Ghostty now gets `kitty-unicode` images automatically without user configuration. Other outer terminals still fall back to ASCII.
- `emotes/ascii/fallback.yaml` renamed to `emotes/ascii/ascii.yaml`.
- Removed `setName === "ascii"` special case — ASCII sets are now resolved through the standard emote set lookup.

## v0.2.6

### Added
- **TmuxKittyUnicodeRenderer** — pane-safe image rendering through tmux using kitty Unicode placeholders (U+10EEEE). Images stay within their pane and clean up on session switch.
- **`"kitty-unicode"` render value** — new option for terminals config. Auto-selected for Ghostty/kitty through tmux.
- **`"placeholder"` frame kind** — new RenderedFrame variant for text-based image display.

### Changed
- **tmux auto-detection** — `"auto"` now resolves to `kitty-unicode` for Ghostty/kitty (pane-safe), ASCII for iTerm2/WezTerm (no pane-safe renderer available).
- **All tmux rendering is experimental and opt-in** — default remains ASCII. Users opt in via `{ "match": "tmux", "render": "auto" }` in their config.
- Classic `"kitty"` and `"iterm2"` DCS passthrough renderers remain available for single-pane setups.

### Fixed
- **Multiplexer routing bug** — concrete render values (e.g., `"ascii"`) from extension defaults were being ignored, falling through to auto-detection.

## v0.2.5

### Changed
- **Multiplexer defaults reverted to ASCII** — tmux/zellij/screen default to `"ascii"` pending renderer fix. Users can opt in to image rendering with `{ "match": "tmux", "render": "auto" }` in their config.

## v0.2.4

### Added
- **tmux passthrough rendering** — image avatars now work through tmux using DCS passthrough. Auto-detects outer terminal via `tmux show-environment TERM_PROGRAM`.
- **TmuxKittyRenderer** — Kitty protocol through tmux (Ghostty, kitty).
- **TmuxITermRenderer** — iTerm2 protocol through tmux (iTerm2, WezTerm).
- **`"auto"` render value** — new option for terminal config entries. Multiplexers use it by default to auto-detect passthrough support and outer terminal.
- **`src/tmux.ts`** — tmux-specific logic: passthrough check, outer terminal detection, DCS wrapping.
- **Multiplexers section** in README with tmux setup instructions.
- **tmux Requirements section** in AGENTS.md with full auto-detection flow.

### Changed
- `resolveRenderer()` returns a `ResolvedRenderer` object (protocol, multiplexer, warning) instead of a plain string.
- `loadLayeredConfig()` returns `{ config, userConfiguredTerminals }` to track explicit user overrides.
- Multiplexer warnings are suppressed when the user explicitly configures a concrete render value.
- Widget supports `padMode: "skip"` for tmux iTerm2 layout (cursor-right instead of spaces on image row).

## v0.2.3

### Added
- **Configurable terminal renderer whitelist** — override image protocol per terminal via `terminals` config array.
- **Community emote sets** — `aza_choi` and `aza_choi_nobg` by [@shennguyenrs](https://github.com/shennguyenrs) (#3).
- **Gallery section** in README showcasing available emote sets.

### Fixed
- **Config merge semantics** — emote entries now correctly append across config layers; terminal entries merge by `match` key.

## v0.2.2

### Fixed
- **Image row overflow** — row calculation now uses the same column count as the actual render, fixing avatar bleeding into content below.
- **Vertical centering** — Kitty renderer uses pixel-level `Y` offset to center the image within its allocated rows, independent of font/cell dimensions.
- **Consistent sizing** — image width, row calculation, and widget padding all use `config.size` consistently (removed off-by-one from `size + 1`).
- Custom Kitty escape sequence builder replaces pi-tui's `encodeKitty`, enabling protocol params (`Y` offset) not exposed by the library.

## v0.2.1

### Added
- **ASCII fallback renderer** — terminals without image support (tmux, Alacritty, VSCode, etc.) now show text-based emotes instead of nothing.
- ASCII emote frames defined in `emotes/ascii/fallback.yaml`.
- Config support for `"emote-set": "ascii"` to force ASCII mode on any terminal.
- Warning notification via `ctx.ui.notify` when falling back to ASCII.

### Changed
- **Renderer architecture split** — rendering logic separated by protocol:
  - `render_kitty.ts` — Kitty graphics protocol (Kitty, Ghostty, WezTerm).
  - `render_iterm.ts` — iTerm2 inline image protocol.
  - `render_ascii.ts` — plain text fallback.
  - `render_image.ts` — shared base class for image renderers.
  - `renderer.ts` — `Renderer` interface and `RenderedFrame` type.
- `animator.ts` is now a pure state machine, delegates all rendering to the `Renderer` interface.
- `widget.ts` handles image, text, and protocol-specific frame rendering.

### Fixed
- Package imports updated from `@mariozechner/*` to `@earendil-works/*`.
- **iTerm2 inline image rendering** — text-first/image-last strategy prevents ghost
  images and `\x1b[2K` erasure artifacts. Uses `preserveAspectRatio` with auto height
  for correct proportions.
- **Kitty image aspect ratio** — no longer forces row count, letting Kitty auto-size
  height to preserve correct proportions.
- Image width increased by 1 cell for better visual sizing in both protocols.
- I/O token stats (`↑input ↓output`) now shown even when zero.

## v0.2.0

Initial alpha release.

- Animated pixel-art emote widget displayed above the editor.
- State machine: hi, idle, think, talk, read, write, tool, success, failure, compact.
- Idle blinking and think swap animations.
- Talk mouth animation synced to token stream with reading-speed pacing.
- Cycling animations for read/write/tool states.
- Per-model emote set selection via glob patterns in config.
- Layered configuration (extension defaults → user global → project local).
- Emote set lookup across project, user, and extension directories.
- Optional `emotes.json` per set for frame configuration (idle/blink, think/hard, talk weights).
